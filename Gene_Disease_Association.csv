Reported craniofacial features include exophthalmos, upslanting palpebral fissures, depressed and wide nasal bridge, hypertelorism, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and facial nevus flammeus. A characteristic limb posture of flexion of the elbows, wrists, and metacarpophalangeal joints has been described. Other features including hypertrichosis, myopia, seizures, central obesity, Wilms tumor, and cardiac, ophthalmologic and gastrointestinal anomalies have been described (PMID: 21706002, 25921057, 26364555).

Pathogenic variants in CFTR may confer an approximately 4-10 fold increased risk for chronic pancreatitis in heterozygous carriers (PMID: 20977904, 21520337, 11729110), although the absolute risk of pancreatitis remains low (less than 1 in 100; PMID: 31882447). Hereditary pancreatitis is characterized by recurrent episodes of acute inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) beginning in childhood or adolescence leading to chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer (PMID: 25170203).
