CDK4-related cutaneous melanoma is characterized by early presentation of atypical nevi and early-onset melanoma (PMID: 15880589, 23384855, 30775140). In a study of individuals with pathogenic CDK4 variants, the penetrance at age 50 was 74% (PMID: 23384855). Additional risk factors including pale skin and excessive sun exposure may amplify lifetime risks."

Uterine leiomyomas, also known as fibroids, are present in nearly all affected females. The lifetime risk for renal cell carcinoma is approximately 21% (PMID: 31831373). Some individuals with a clinically significant change in FH may also develop paragangliomas (PGL) and pheochromocytomas (PCC). PGL are nervous system tumors that often form in the head, neck, spine or abdomen. PCC are adrenal gland tumors that may cause symptoms including tachycardia and hypertension. Most PGL and PCC are benign and while there is malignant potential, lifetime cancer risks are not clear."

LOF SMAD4 variants have been reported in individuals with symptoms of both JPS and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). HHT is characterized by multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), including small AVMs called telangiectasias.      The SMAD4 gene is associated with autosomal dominant juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) (MedGen UID: 87518), hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) (MedGen UID: 331400) and Myhre syndrome (MedGen UID: 167103).  Loss-of-function (LOF) variants in SMAD4 are associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS), a condition characterized by the development of numerous hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The risk of developing GI cancer is 40-50% (PMID: 22846733, 9869523). There is also a 21% risk of gastric cancer (PMID: 12221036) and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer; although, lifetime risks are not established (PMID: 20859198, 2705469). LOF SMAD4 variants have been reported in individuals with symptoms of both JPS and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). HHT is characterized by multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), including small AVMs called telangiectasias.

LFS is a cancer predisposition syndrome associated with sarcoma, brain cancer, breast cancer, adrenocortical carcinoma and other malignancies. Affected individuals often develop cancers in childhood or early adulthood, and are at increased risk for multiple primary cancers. Overall lifetime cancer risks have been reported as high as 73% for males and nearly 100% for females (PMID: 10864200). It is estimated that 7-20% of LFS cases are due to a de novo pathogenic variant (PMID: 19556618). It should be noted that acquired (somatic) variants may arise in the blood, particularly with advancing age, and may even appear heterozygous (PMID: 25426837, 25426838, 31490007, 31881331).

Dominant,Lynch Syndrome,"Autosomal dominant Lynch syndrome (also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome, or HNPCC) (MedGen UID: 232603).  Lynch syndrome is characterized by an increased risk of colorectal cancer as well as cancers of the uterus/endometrium, ovary, stomach, bladder, biliary tract, urinary tract, prostate, brain and possibly small intestines. Estimated lifetime risks for individuals with a pathogenic variant in MSH2 and/or EPCAM include a 33-52% risk for colorectal cancer, up to a 9% risk for gastric cancer, up to a 1.7% risk for cancer of the biliary tract, a 2-28% risk for urinary tract cancer, a 4-13% risk for bladder cancer and a 3-8% risk for brain/central nervous system cancer.

To date, loss-of-function variants in CTNNA1 have not been associated with butterfly-shaped pigmentary macular dystrophy.  Butterfly-shaped pigmentary macular dystrophy is a form of patterned dystrophies of the retinal pigment epithelium, characterized by accumulation of pigment in the macula that resembles the wings of a butterfly (PMID: 12724643). Affected individuals typically present from middle age with mildly reduced visual acuity and color vision. The activity of the RPE measured by electrooculogram (EOG) recordings may be abnormal (PMID: 26691986). Retinitis pigmentosa-like changes have been observed in some cases (PMID: 22466463).

Pathogenic gain-of-function (GOF) RET variants cause MEN2, a condition associated with cancers of the endocrine glands that has two clinical subtypes: MEN2A and MEN2B. MEN2A is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) (up to 95% of cases), pheochromocytoma (20-50% of cases) and hyperparathyroidism (10-30% of cases). Clinical variability within and among families has been described (PMID: 33812987). Some individuals with MEN2A may only develop medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is also known as familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) (PMID: 21552134, 31390501). In addition to the same risks for medullary thyroid cancer and pheochromocytoma, MEN2B is also associated with tall stature, arachnodactyly, hypermobility, scoliosis and neuromas in the intestines and perioral area. 

Pathogenic loss-of-function (LOF) RET variants are associated with Hirschsprung disease (HD), a condition characterized by congenital agenesis of ganglion in the colon. HD is typically diagnosed in early infancy, although less severe cases may be diagnosed later in childhood (PMID: 16448984)."

There is an increased risk for neoplasia, particularly Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, adrenocortical carcinoma and rhabdomyosarcoma; these risks are highest in the newborn period through eight years of age (PMID: 24335096, 24911853, 20301568)."
Dominant,Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome,"Autosomal dominant Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome (MedGen UID: 91070). There is also evidence suggesting BHD is associated with an increased risk of colon polyps and colorectal cancer (PMID: 20522427, 20392993). The data, however, are preliminary and insufficient to made a determination regarding this relationship.  BHD is characterized by an increased risk to develop noncancerous cysts in the lungs (70% risk) and kidneys (12-34% risk) in addition to acrochordons, fibrofolliculomas and trichodiscomas on the face neck and upper body.
